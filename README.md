# Movie-Trailer-Website
This is a project that launches a website with six of my favorite movies using Python.
# Viewing the website
You can simply view the website by downloading **fresh_tomatoes.html** and opening it in your browser.

Alternatively, here are the steps to follow to use Python to launch the website:
1. Download the files in this repo
2. In your terminal, go to the directory that you downloaded this repo into and type
	`python entertainment_center.py`
3. The command above will launch your default browser and display the contents of the newly created **fresh_tomatoes.html**

# Resource
**fresh_tomatoes.py** starter code was provided by Udacity. (You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode).) While the functionality is the identical to the original, I altered a few lines to reflect my code in **media.py**.

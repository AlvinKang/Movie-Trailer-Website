# MovieTrailer
This is a project that launches a website with six of my favorite movies using Python. **Please ensure the version of Python is 2.7.**

Alternatively, you can view the website [here](https://alvinkang.github.io/MovieTrailer/).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Be sure to have the latest verison of Python 2.7 installed. You can visit this [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to get what you need. 

### Installing
Here are the steps to follow to use Python to launch the website:
1. Download the files in this repository as a ZIP.
2. In your terminal, go to the directory that you downloaded this repo into and type
```python entertainment_center.py```
3. The command above will launch your default browser and display the contents of the newly created **fresh_tomatoes.html**

## Acknowledgements
**fresh_tomatoes.py** starter code was provided by Udacity. (You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode).) While the functionality is the identical to the original, I altered a few lines to reflect my code in **media.py**.
